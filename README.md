AI Knowledge Workbench 2025

Enterprise RAG System for Developers
A next-gen Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that unifies vector search, knowledge graphs, and LLM-powered insightsâ€”all in an enterprise-ready platform tailored for complex developer workflows.

Overview

AI Knowledge Workbench 2025 is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines:

* Multi-source ingestion (codebases, documents, web, media).
* Hybrid retrieval (Weaviate vector search + LlamaIndex knowledge graph).
* LLM-powered code analysis and codebase understanding.
* Collaboration tools for real-time knowledge sharing and annotation.
* Enterprise-ready features like auditing, RBAC, data lineage tracking, and plugin-based extensibility.

Installation

* Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* Weaviate (Can use Embedded Weaviate or a remote instance)
* Virtual Environment recommended
